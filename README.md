GiantTreesRevived
=================

Since the original author of GiantTrees, CMahaff, has moved on to bigger and better things, I have adopted the plugin and am working to update and expand its functionality.

TODO:
- Get the darn thing to load
- Add support for 1.7's new logs and leaves
- Replace diamond-shaped trunks with cylinders
- Add option for hollow trunks
- Redesign canopy for improved realism
- Fix derped trees at small sizes
- Completely redesign tree generation to use a more realistic branching path sphere-based mechanic
